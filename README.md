# Movie Budget Analysis

This project performs a statistical analysis of movie budgets using a movie dataset. The analysis includes calculating central tendencies, dispersion measures, confidence intervals, and visualizing the budget distribution.

## Features

- Loads movie data from a CSV file.
- Calculates key statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error for the movie budget.
- Determines the shape of the budget distribution (skewness).
- Visualizes the budget data with histograms and boxplots.
- Computes confidence intervals for the mean and variance.
- Demonstrates the use of statistical tests like t-distribution and z-distribution.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a movie dataset containing various movie attributes such as budget, genres, popularity, runtime, vote averages, and more.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the `movie_dataset.csv` file in the specified directory or update the file path in the code.
3. Run the Python script to see statistical outputs and visualizations.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- numpy
- statistics (standard Python library)
